# Ted's custom vim config

It's a work in progress. Below is a list of key bindings and notes.
The layout and some configurations are based on the [EdgeCase vim
configuration](https://github.com/edgecase/vim-config). I've pulled
the basic directory layout and Vundle setup, but kept most of my
plugin choices and keymaps.

Below is a list of plugin descriptions and keymap changes.

## Setup

1. `git clone git://github.com/tedkulp/vim-config.git`
2. `cd vim-config`
3. `sh setup.sh`
4. `vim`
5. `:BundleInstall`

## "Project Drawer" aka NERDTree

NERDTree is a file explorer plugin that provides "project drawer"
functionality to your vim projects.  You can learn more about it with
`:help NERDTree`.

**Customizations**:

Use `gt` to toggle NERDTree

## Ack.vim

Ack.vim uses ack to search inside the current directory for a pattern.
You can learn more about it with :help Ack

**Customizations**:

* `g/` to bring up `:Ack `.

## indent-object

Indent object creates a "text object" that is relative to the current
ident. Text objects work inside of visual mode, and with `c` (change),
`d` (delete) and `y` (yank). For instance, try going into a method in
normal mode, and type `v ii`. Then repeat `ii`. Also, `ai`.

## surround

Surround allows you to modify "surroundings" around the current text.
For instance, if the cursor was inside `"foo bar"`, you could type
`cs"'` to convert the text to `'foo bar'`.

There's a lot more; check it out at `:help surround`

## FuzzyFinder

Provides convenient ways to quickly reach the
buffer/file/command/bookmark/tag you want. FuzzyFinder searches with the
fuzzy/partial pattern to which it converted an entered pattern.

* `<leader>t` - fuzzy find files
* `<leader>b` - fuzzy find open buffers
* `<leader>T` - use fuzzy finder to navigate via tags instead of built-in tag navigation
* `<C-j>` - open selected item in window in horizontal split
* `<C-k>` - open selected item in vertical split

## Fugitive

I'm not going to lie to you; fugitive.vim may very well be the best
Git wrapper of all time.  Check out these features:

View any blob, tree, commit, or tag in the repository with `:Gedit` (and
`:Gsplit`, `:Gvsplit`, `:Gtabedit`, ...).  Edit a file in the index and
write to it to stage the changes.  Use `:Gdiff` to bring up the staged
version of the file side by side with the working tree version and use
Vim's diff handling capabilities to stage a subset of the file's
changes.

Bring up the output of `git status` with `:Gstatus`.  Press `-` to
`add`/`reset` a file's changes, or `p` to `add`/`reset` `--patch` that
mofo.  And guess what `:Gcommit` does!

`:Gblame` brings up an interactive vertical split with `git blame`
output.  Press enter on a line to reblame the file as it stood in that
commit, or `o` to open that commit in a split.  When you're done, use
`:Gedit` in the historic buffer to go back to the work tree version.

`:Gmove` does a `git mv` on a file and simultaneously renames the
buffer.  `:Gremove` does a `git rm` on a file and simultaneously deletes
the buffer.

Use `:Ggrep` to search the work tree (or any arbitrary commit) with
`git grep`, skipping over that which is not tracked in the repository.
`:Glog` loads all previous revisions of a file into the quickfix list so
you can iterate over them and watch the file evolve!

`:Gread` is a variant of `git checkout -- filename` that operates on the
buffer rather than the filename.  This means you can use `u` to undo it
and you never get any warnings about the file changing outside Vim.
`:Gwrite` writes to both the work tree and index versions of a file,
making it like `git add` when called from a work tree file and like
`git checkout` when called from the index or a blob in history.

Use `:Gbrowse` to open the current file on GitHub, with optional line
range (try it in visual mode!).  If your current repository isn't on
GitHub, `git instaweb` will be spun up instead.

Add `%{fugitive#statusline()}` to `'statusline'` to get an indicator
with the current branch in (surprise!) your statusline.

Oh, and of course there's `:Git` for running any arbitrary command.
